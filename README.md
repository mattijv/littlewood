# Littlewood conjecture

This repo contains a program for computational investigation of the
[Littlewood conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlewood_conjecture)
using continued fractions.


The code depends on [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) for the arbitrary precision
integer math, and on [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) for wide fixed width
integer math.

The code uses [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for string formatting.

Check the makefile for options on compiling and running the program.
